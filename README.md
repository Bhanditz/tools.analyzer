# tools.analyzer

An analyzer for Clojure code, written in Clojure and producing AST in EDN.

Timothy Baldridge gave a talk on tools.analyzer[.jvm] at Clojure/West in
March 2014. Video
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhRQmT22SSg&list=PLZdCLR02grLp__wRg5OTavVj4wefg69hM&index=11).

Note that this library is not to be used directly, instead platform specific extensions should be used.
Currently the following platform specific extensions exist: [tools.analyzer.jvm](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.jvm), [tools.analyzer.js](https://github.com/clojure/tools.analyzer.js)
